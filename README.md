# Introduction
- This repository is intended to provide insights into the Proton.VPN.Native.Host application.
- This content is publicly available for educational purposes.
- I cannot be held responsible for any misuse of this information
- This review will focus on the `Windows x64 branch`. 
- Because `Windows x64` is considered the most straightforward operating system for reverse engineering, I selected with this version instead of `x32` variant or `.apk` variants . 
-  The tools employed for this analysis include `XNTSV` + `IDA 8.3` for overview as well as `64dbg` debbuger for debug.
- Please be aware that this project is solely for educational purposes, and I am not a professional reverse engineer, just a student, additionally, my English proficiency may not be entirely perfect.
