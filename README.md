# Introduction
- This is a repo to gather some info about `Proton.VPN.Native.Host`
- This content is set to Public for eductationnal purposes, I am not responsible, do whatever.
- This review will focus on the `Windows x64 branch`. Due to `Win64` being the easiest OS for reverse engineering I went with this version instead of `x32` variant or `.apk` variants . 
- Methodology: I used `XNTSV latest` + `IDA 8.3` for overview as well as `64dbg` for debug.
- Please note that I am doing this to learn reverse engineering and I am in no way shape or form a professional about this matter, just a student, also my English might be far from perfect.
